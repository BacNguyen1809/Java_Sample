# Java_Sample
Short Assignment_101
Objective:
Able to install the compilation, execution environment and write the first java program.
Run an application based on Java technology from the command line
Exercise 1
Write a Java program, called ArithmeticExercise1 to print the result of the following operations.

Test Data:

-5 + 8 * 6
(55+9) % 9
20 + -3*5 / 8
5 + 15 / 3 * 2 - 8 % 3
Expected Output :

43

1

19

13

Exercise 2
Write a Java program, called ArithmeticExercise2 to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.

Test Data:

Input first number: 125

Input second number: 24

Expected Output:

125 + 24 = 149

125 - 24 = 101

125 x 24 = 3000

125 / 24 = 5

125 % 24 = 5


Exercise 3
Write a Java program, called JavaExercise to display the following pattern.

Sample Pattern:

   J    a   v     v  a                                                 

   J   a a   v   v  a a                                                

J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa                                               

 JJ  a     a   V  a     a

 

Exercise 4
Write a Java program, called ArithmeticExercise3 to compute the specified expressions and print the output.

Test Data:

((25.5 * 3.5 - 3.5 * 3.5) / (40.5 - 4.5))

Expected Output

2.138888888888889


Exercise 5
Write a Java program, called CircleExercise to enter radius of a circle and print the area, perimeter of this circle.

Test Data:

Radius = 7.5

Expected Output

Perimeter is = 47.12388980384689

Area is = 176.71458676442586


Exercise 6
Write a Java program, called RectangleExercise to enter the width and height of a rectangle and  print the area and perimeter of this rectangle.

Test Data:

Width = 5.5 Height = 8.5

Expected Output:

Area is 5.5 * 8.5 = 46.75

Perimeter is 2 * (5.5 + 8.5) = 28.00


Exercise 7
Write a Java program, called LogicalExercise to compare two numbers.

Input Data:

Input first integer: 25

Input second integer: 39

Expected Output:

25 != 39                                                                         

25 < 39                                                                           

25 <= 39
